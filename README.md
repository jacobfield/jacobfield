## üöÄ About Me
I am a highly motivated and team-focused problem-solver, dedicated to launching my tech career. My passion for learning and technology is evident in my Master's research, where I explored the ethical implementations of AI development. This enthusiasm drives my commitment to working in tech, with a focus on shaping future AIs within a friendly ethical framework. I am analytically minded and am committed to continuous learning and personal development.

I love AI and deep learning, and am pursuing a career that reflects this passion! ‚ú®

## üé∏ Hobbies & Interests
Beyond work, I hone my musical skills, playing the guitar, bass, and drums. An ardent American Football fan, I am the founder of a flag American Football team ‚Äì the Derbyshire Ducks ü¶Ü.

## üåê Tech Stack
I am currently expanding my tech stack day by day. I have hands-on experience with:
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript
- PostgreSQL, React, Next.js, Express.js
- OpenAI API for a Haiku Generator project
- Chakra UI and SupaBase for a reading record app
- React for a Noughts and Crosses app

## üí° Tech Work Experience
### Bootcamper at School Of Code (Sept 2023 - Dec 2023)
During the bootcamp, I trained to be job-ready by developing strong teamwork, problem-solving, and computational thinking skills in an Agile working framework. I learned how to work in a tech role by being thrown into real-world problems in a learning environment that simulated a tech job and industry best practices.

#### Notable Projects:
1. **OpenAI Haiku Generator:**
   - Showcased passion for AI and commitment to learning.
   - Utilized the OpenAI API in a React-based app to generate Haikus based on user input.
   - Enriched skills in using the OpenAI API, managing API Keys, and implementing environment variables with React.

2. **The Reading Room:**
   - Led problem ownership, fostering collaboration and accountability.
   - Developed a Next.js app with Chakra UI and SupaBase for full-stack capabilities.
   - Implemented a restful API to address children's reading habits, serving as a 'reading record.'
   - Introduced gamification inspired by DuoLingo for enhanced user engagement.

3. **Noughts & Crosses:**
   - Utilized React to develop a Noughts and Crosses app, delving into advanced React features.
   - Contributed significantly to the team's rapid learning by explaining React Components and array methods.
   - Highlighted effectiveness as a communicator and team member committed to continuous learning.

## ü§ù Let's Collaborate!
I'm looking to collaborate on everything! I am currently working my first job in tech at School of Code and am very excited about learning new skills, collaborating with other people, and developing myself for my future career.

- 👋 Hi, I’m @jacobfield. I love to learn, and to develop my skills through problem solving. I am motivated by breaking down a problem to its most basic components and building a practical solition.
 
- 👀 I’m interested in music; I have taught myself to play the guitar, bass guitar and drums. I also am interested in American Football, and run a non-contact team in Derbyshire - the Derbyshire Ducks 🦆

- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Python, but am growing my Tech Stack day by day - I am driven by my love to learn!
 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on everything!

- I am currently working my first job in tech at School of Code, and am very excited at the prospect of learning new skills, collaborating with other people, and developing myself ready for my future career.
